# What to look out for in Unit Tests

A well-designed suite of unit tests provides a safety net for making changes and additions to your codebase with confidence. A good unit test should encapsulate the following:

- Isolation: Each unit test should be isolated, meaning it tests a specific piece of functionality without relying on external factors or dependencies.

- Coverage: Tests should cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases to ensure that the code behaves correctly in various situations.

- Assertion: Clear and meaningful assertions should be present to verify that the expected outcome matches the actual outcome.

- Independence: Tests should not depend on the order of execution or the results of other tests.

- Fast Execution: Unit tests should run quickly to allow for frequent execution during development.

- Readability: Tests should be easy to read and understand by using descriptive names and clear structure.

- Maintainability: Tests should be easy to maintain as the code evolves, without requiring frequent updates.

- Consistency: Test naming conventions, structure, and organization should be consistent across the codebase.

- Mocking: Dependencies should be mocked or stubbed to isolate the code being tested.

- Refactoring Safety: Tests should catch regressions and breakages when code is refactored.

- Error Handling: Tests should cover error scenarios and ensure that the error-handling code functions correctly.

- Good and descriptive commenting
